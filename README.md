#AWS CloudFormation Templates

This is a set of CloudFormation Templates for AWS.

I primarily put these together as part of studying for the AWS Solution Architect exam, but I figured they could be of use in the future for other folk too?

* [Pre-requisites](pre-requisites.md)
* [Using CloudFormation](using-cloudformation.md)

##Templates

* [Basic Standalone Server](basic-standalone-server/index.md) (using CloudFormation)
* [S3 Website](s3-website/index.md) (using CloudFormation)
* [Basic Standalone Web Server](basic-standalone-webserver/index.md) (using Packer, Puppet and CloudFormation)
* [Basic Load Balanced Web Server](basic-loadbalanced-webserver/index.md) (using Packer, Puppet and CloudFormation)

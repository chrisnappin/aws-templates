#AWS CloudFormation Templates

This is a set of CloudFormation Templates for AWS.

I primarily put these together as part of studying for the AWS Solution Architect exam, but they could be of use in the future and maybe even for others.

##Templates

* [Basic Standalone Server](basic-standalone-server/index.md)
